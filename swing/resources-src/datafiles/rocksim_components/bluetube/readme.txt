Blue Tube 2.0 Rocksim Installation Instructions
3/6/10

Installation Instructions:

Extract this zip file to a temporary location you should have three files and this "readme"

BTDATA.CSV
MATERIAL.CSV
TCDATA.CSV

Copy these three files to the "DATAIMPORT" folder of your Rocksim Installation.

(This would USUALLY be C:\Program Files\Rocksim(X)\Dataimport) where X is your version.

if you can't find this folder, contact Apogee Components.

Once those files are copied there, launch Rocksim.  Rocksim will import this new data into the parts database.


NOTE FOR ROCKSIM 7 and below:

Open the files in excel and copy the contents (not including the headers) of the download files and paste them into the corresponding files in the RockSim DATA folder. Make a backup copy first in case there is a problem.
Or, try this:

For RockSim 7, it works the same way as v9, except that the folder was different.  Instead of the "DATAIMPORT" folder, you must create a folder called "New" under the "DATA" folder.  Then extract the .csv files into that "DATA\New" folder.



That's it!

Add a body tube and scroll all the way to the bottom and see ARR's airframe selections.

Have fun!
