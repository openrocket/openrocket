2013-05-04 Sampo Niskanen

	* Released version 13.05

2013-04-17 Bill Kuker and Kevin Ruland
    * Added support for decals on rockets.  Added two new 3d views - 3d finished and 3d unfinshed.  Added support to export and
      apply decals (images) to rocket components.  Added ability to launch external graphics editor to edit decals and monitor
      file for writes to update the rocket view.

2013-04-17 Kevin Ruland
    * Added simulation of tumble recovery based on experimentation done by Sampo Niskane.  This is particularly useful
      for low power staged flights.

2013-04-17 Kevin Ruland
    * Extended "motor configuration" concept to cover more properties.  The concept was renamed "Flight Configuration" and
      allows the user to override stage separation, recovery deployment, and motor ignition per flight configuration.
      These configurations are stored in the ork file with each component.  If no override is specified then the user specified
      default is used (set in the component edit dialog).  The flight configuration dialog was reworked to make it more
      usable.  The user selects the configuration in a drop down with buttons for "add", "delete" and "rename".  After selecting
      the configuration, the tabbed area below allows the user to change the configuration for this simulation.

2013-04-17 Kevin Ruland
    * Allow simulation of stages without a motor.  Users in the past have attempted to simulate separate recovery of payload
      and booster by tricking OpenRocket using a dummy motor with trivial thrust curve.  Now the user does not need to do this.
      There is an example of this provided in TARC Payloader.ork and Boosted Dart.ork

2013-04-17 Kevin Ruland
    * Simulate recovery of boosters.  The simulation engine will create new FlightDataBranches for each stage after
      separation.  The data for the boosters begins at t=separation.  The simulation plot allows the user to select
      which stage's data to show (or all).

2013-04-17 Kevin Ruland
    * Modified the zoom and pan controls in the simulation plot.  Added zoom in, out, and reset buttons.  Added
      scroll with mouse wheel.  If the alt key is used with either of these, only the domain is zoomed.  Richard
      contributed a more logical mouse controlled zoom - right click and drag will zoom (either domain, range or both).

   or picking from the Most-recently-used list.

2012-06-24  Bill Kuker

    * OSX UI Elements: Screen menu bar, Application name, Dock Icon, Quit, About & Preference
