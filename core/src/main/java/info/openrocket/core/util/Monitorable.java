	/**
	 * Return a modification ID unique to the current state of this object and
	 * contained objects.
	 * The general contract is that if a specific object has the same modification
	 * ID at two moments
	 * in time, then the state of the object has not changed in between.
	 * Additionally the
	 * modification ID value must be monotonically increasing. This value can be
	 * used as a monitor
	 * to whether an object has been changed between two points of time.
	 * <p>
	 * Implementations may optionally fulfill the stronger requirement that any two
	 * objects of the same
	 * type that have the same modification ID will be equal, though for complex
	 * objects guaranteeing
	 * this may be impractical.
	 * <p>
	 * Objects that contain only primitive types or immutable objects can implement
	 * this method by
	 * increasing a modification counter or retrieving a new unique ID every time a
	 * value is set.
	 * <p>
	 * Objects that contain other objects with a mutable state may for example
	 * return the sum of the
	 * object's own modification ID, a modification ID counter (initially zero) and
	 * the modification IDs
	 * of the contained objects. When a mutable object is set, the modification
	 * counter is increased by
	 * the modification ID of the current object in order to preserve monotonicity.
	 * <p>
	 * If an object does not have any fields, this method can simply return zero.
	 * <p>
	 * Cloned objects may or may not have the same modification ID as the original
	 * object.
	 * 
	 * @return a modification ID value for this object.
